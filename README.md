# HDMI_FPGA
Gonna try and make HDMI stuff with Verilog and an FPGA. Wish me luck, I'm gonna need it :) 

1). Work on 8b/10b encoding (I'm gonna code the transmitter first).
     7/14/2020 - this project was a bit above my head. Im gonna stop work on it for a while (I might look at some examples from opencores in a few months) but will leave the code                   up if anyone sees :) good luck
     
2). Trying to update the FPGA4fun HDMI code from ISE 2013 to Vivado 2020 on a 7 series device
